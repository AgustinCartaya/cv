    "description": "This project proposes an engaging, interactive approach to teach about U-Net's components through a detective-themed game. Participants investigate the causes of poor segmentation results for Dr. Luna, a data scientist, exploring the U-Net architecture to identify key components. This hands-on experience enhances understanding while emphasizing the real-world importance of improving segmentation in medical imaging. This report outlines the steps taken to develop the project and gather participant feedback.",
