    "title":"Brain Tumour Detection Using Dempster Shafer Combination",
    "description": "This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation from MRI images. The proposed method integrates data from multiple MRI modalities—T1, T2, FLAIR, and ADC—using the Dempster-Shafer theory to achieve 3D tumor segmentation. In this approach, each modality generates 3D maps where each voxel is assigned a probability between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of being part of a tumor. These probabilities are then combined using Dempster’s rule, resulting in a final image with improved certainty about tumor presence. The method was applied to 3D images from glioma patients in the UCSF-PDGM database.",
